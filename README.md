## Principles

1. Always be aware of what's going on in your team and product.
1. Know the architecture just as well as anyone else; and stay current with the tech stack. Also, be aware how your team's architecture connects to other teams.
1. Schedule 1-1s with your direct reports on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
1. Be customer-focused. Understand how our products are used in the wild. For example, join support calls.
1. Set aggressive but achievable goals, and invest in clear tenets to guide your program.
1. Think "glocally". Combine the local priorities of your team with the overarching goals of the company. 
1. When giving advice or feedback, ask open questions to encourage ownership.
1. Have a bias for action and decision-making over planning and consensus.
1. Know to differentiate between reversible vs. irreversible decisions.
1. No task is below a manager. Get your hands dirty even if it's not always coding:

## One on ones

1. Never skip one on ones. It's the best platform for getting and providing feedback. Most teammates value it and usually when they don't it's because they haven't seen one conducted well.
1. Focus on 5 topics every meeting:
    - Predictability: create routine, set expectations, normalize change.
    - Ownership: offer options, clarify ownership, give more responsibilities.
    - Purpose: clarify the big picture value and importance of their tasks.
    - Progress: create milestones, share wins, celebrate progress.
    - Belonging: team culture and management.
1. Questions to help frame each topic. "On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate:..."
    - Predictability: How clear do you feel about what's expected of you?
    - Ownership: Your satisfaction with decision power and direction?
    - Purpose: How much your work makes a difference for the team?
    - Progress: The sense of progression each week?
    - Belonging: Your feeling of connection to the team?
1. Additional questions to ask on a less frequent basis:
    1. Motivators:
        1. Which part of your work is most fun?
        1. What's not fun about working here?
        1. What are the biggest time wasters for you each week?
    1. Long term goals:
        1. What skills do you want to improve?
        1. What career path are you looking for?
        1. Who in the company would you be excited to learn more from?
        1. What parts of the business would you like to be more involved in?
    1. Organization awareness:
        1. What don't you like about the product?
        1. What's the biggest opportunity that we're missing out on?
        1. What do you see as your top 3 priorities this quarter? The team’s? The org's?
        1. If you were CEO, what would you do differently?
    1. Manager's role:
        1. What could I do to support you better?
        1. If you were me, what changes would you make?
        1. How do you feel about the amount of feedback you are getting?
        1. I need feedback. What are two things that I can do differently?
        1. What's one thing we could do to improve our way of collaborating?
1. Encourage your direct reports to bring up topics in 1-1. [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) made a great [zine](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/22/new-zine--help--i-have-a-manager/) on it:

## Giving advice

1. Open-ended questions: ask questions starting with **what**, **how**, **who** instead of closed-ended ones like **do**, **have**, **is** to invite conversation and give ownership over a problem.
    - "What questions do you have?" is better than "Do you have any questions?".
    - "Why do you think this is the right approach?" is better than "Is this a good idea?".
1. Playback: summarize what the person is saying so you're both on the same page and are pinpointing the problem.
    -  "It sounds like there are two issues, x and y. Which should we focus on first?"
1. Figure out how to make this meeting productive.
    - "What's the next step?"
    - "How should we track this?""

## Feedback

1. Be prompt, ideally providing feedback the same day of the event that prompted it.
1. Be specific even if it's positive feedback.
    - "Good job!"  ⛔️
    - "I like the initiative you took to reduce the service's memory footprint"
1. Get buy-in about providing feedback and reduce mystery:
    - "Do you have 10 minutes to talk about this morning's stand up?"
    - "Can I share some thoughts with you about how we've been working together?"
1. Don't "pad" by beginning with compliments - it gives mixed signals.
1. Focus on data and not behavior:
    - "I noticed you didn't address any of the comments made in your last three PRs"
    - "I noticed that you didn't pick up the ticket I asked you to do"
    - "I noticed your last feature release didn't have any tests"
    - "Your code is buggy"  ⛔️
    - "You are always late"  ⛔️
1. Talk about why this matters and who it's affecting:
    - "I mention it because it's important we work as a team"
    - "I mention it because the ticket I assigned you is critical to this quarter's roadmap"
1. Figure out together how to fix the problem:
    - "What do you think of our process?"
    - "How do you see it?"
1. Agree on an action plan:
    - "How do we ensure we don't miss a ticket due date next time?"
    - "What are a couple of actions you could take right now?"
    - "What are our action items?"
1. Highlight positive patterns (remember to be specific).
1. Replay instinctive reactions to help frame the conversation:

1. Resources on feedback
    1. [The Feedback Fallacy](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy): focus on replaying positive performance so team members know how to repeat excellence.

## Thinking strategically

1. What would you do with more one person?
1. How is your team moving the needle? Are you focusing on the right things? How do you know the features you're building will benefit the customer?
1. What are your products' respective mission and tenets?
1. What pillars are your team driving and in what way?
1. What are your team's pain points? How can you move 2x?
1. What "dogs not barking" do you worry about? What are areas in your team you worry about?

## Making decisions

1. Determine if the decision is [reversible vs. irreversible](https://fs.blog/2018/04/reversible-irreversible-decisions/).
    - Reversible decisions can easily be changed. Examples: changing stand up time, contributing guidelines.
    - Irreversible decisions cannot be changed without significant rework. These decisions should take
  longer and be documented and discussed. Examples: architecture changes, language decision, data models.  
1. Whenever there is disagreement, focus on the intended outcome of the decision and make sure the team
is aware of your reasoning.
    - "While database X is better, I want us to standardize on one stack so that it's easier to maintain."
1. If someone disagrees with a reversible decision, set a date to revisit that decision with the team.
Ideally you also have metrics to define the success of that decision.
    - "I understand your concerns. Let's revisit this in a month and see where we stand."
    - "We're tracking X now, let's revisit next quarter if it improves with these changes."
1. If someone disagrees with an irreversible decision, give them the opportunity to present their case.
Regardless, everyone should be aware the decision is ultimately yours and the team needs
to [disagree and commit wholly](https://tomtunguz.com/disagree-and-commit/) to the decision made.

## Coding

1. As a rule of thumb, a manager should spend their time coding roughly `(100 - NUM_DIRECT_REPORTS * 10)%`.
1. Avoid coding in the critical path. [Tips](https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/) from [Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy):
    - Authoring a feature?  ⛔️
    - Covering on-call when someone needs a break?  ✅
    - Diving on the biggest project after a postmortem?  ⛔️
    - Code reviews?  ✅
    - Picking up a p2 bug that's annoying but never seems to become top priority?  ✅
    - Insisting that all commits be gated on their approval?  ⛔️
    - Cleaning up the monitoring checks and writing a library to generate coverage?  ✅

## Ticket and PR process

1. Set contributing guidelines for the team.
1. PRs should always be prioritized. Aim for review SLA of 1 hour.
1. Automate opinions like style with linting or code formatters like [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).

## Meetings

1. Avoid [shitty brainstorm sessions](https://erikbern.com/2017/12/29/toxic-meeting-culture.html). Meetings should be for decisioning. Encourage others to research the problem and make a proposal coming into a meeting.
1. Always end a meeting with actions, owners and timing.
1. Encourage ["6 pagers" and "2 pagers"](https://medium.com/@inowland/using-6-page-and-2-page-documents-to-make-organizational-decisions-3216badde909).

## Hiring

> The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. Randall E. Stross

Hiring is the most important decision a manager makes.

What to look for:

* **Passion for technology**. Does the candidate contribute to open source, personal projects, write articles, teach others, host meetups?
* **Passion for your team or company's mission**.
* **Enjoys team work**. Make sure to evaluate group problem solving with candidate in interview. Does the candidate take feedback well?

What to watch out for:

* **Short tenure at companies**. If a candidate typically stays at companies for less than a year, ask them why. There might be perfectly valid reasons or it might indicate a pattern that the person is difficult to work with.

## Onboarding

Having a good onboarding process is crucial to the success of your team and new team members. It insures team members are contributing as early as possible and assimilated your team.

An onboarding process is successful if your new team member can contribute a bug fix on the first day of joining.

Create a space in Confluence that includes:

1. Team mission
    1. How is your team moving the needle for the customer?
1. Team members
1. Repositories and services
1. Documentation:
    1. Code contributing guidelines
    1. Ticketing process. E.g. label and story pointing guidelines.
    1. Glossary of terms.
    1. Releasing code.
    1. How tos (e.g. migrate database, add secrets)
1. Getting started:
    1. Installation instructions (e.g. Docker, postgres).
    1. Getting the right accesses (e.g. PagerDuty).
    1. Running your apps locally.
1. Meeting setups. Who should your new team member meet with?
